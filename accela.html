        Much like the web, you gotta be safe.

        The ideal stage is where you can't feel your own body and you just float around. Remember: you don't need your physical body. Always remember to be careful to what you download around the Wired because just like the Internet viruses made to trick the foolish and vulnerable are much prevalent, be sure to have fun but don't use it only for that afterall you can download very useful info.
